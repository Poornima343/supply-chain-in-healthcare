# Blockchain-based healthcare supply chain management

How much do we really know about our medicine? Can we be sure it hasnâ€™t been tampered with? Is it coming from a legitimate supplier? 

Our aim is to first eliminate centralized mechanisms and make the healthcare system more transparent and traceable efficiently handling the supply system of medicines with ease on the level of the distributor to retailer and customers and secondly, to answer above questions.

It is an Ethereum blockchain-based approach leveraging smart contracts and decentralized off-chain storage for efficient product traceability in the healthcare supply chain. The smart contract guarantees data provenance, eliminates the need for intermediaries, and provides a secure, immutable history of transactions to all stakeholders.
